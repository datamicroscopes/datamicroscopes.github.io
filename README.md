This repo uses [datamicroscopes' release repo](https://github.com/datamicroscopes/release) to build documentation for the webpage.

Pushing to this repo will update the website.

To update documentation based on updated modules, please follow instructions for building a new conda release in the release repo.  Travis will generate Sphinx documentation based if tests pass.
